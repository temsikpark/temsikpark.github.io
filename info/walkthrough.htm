<p class="style1">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>7:02pm</strong></p>
<p class="style2">The protagonist, Sissel, awakens in a junkyard to see
a woman who he doesn't know. Also present is an unfamiliar blue man.
The blue man suddenly aims his shotgun at the woman. As much as Sissel
would like to help her out, he is unable to do so as he has the not so
small problem of already being dead. Just when it looks like all hope
is lost, a voice suddenly speaks to Sissel from out of nowhere and the
entire world changes. After a brief explanation about souls and cores,
the voice instructs Sissel to move to the crossing gate.</p>
<p class="style2">Following the instructions is simple enough here as
the game will guide you. Raising the crossing gate will knock the
shotgun out of the man's hands (his name is Nearsighted Jeego by the
way. Maybe he can't afford a pair of glasses.) The woman attempts to
make a break for it but is quickly held at gunpoint again. Your next
step is to move to the guitar since you are unable to reach the very
useful wrecking ball. Manipulate it and Jeego will proceed to riddle it
full of bullet holes. His target starts running again but her efforts
are in vain due to being the slowest runner in the world.</p>
<p class="style2">The only core left to Sissel is that of his corpse
lying right there. Jump in and attempt to "trick" it a few times. The
terrible truth soon dawns on Sissel - he is in fact unable to
manipulate corpses. Now he's run out of options and that woman is still
in grave danger. At this point, the voice suggests that you take a look
by sliding the screen around. Simply slide the screen until she is in
your sights. A scene plays out in which the hitman fires his weapon,
taking the woman's life. After disposing of his target, the phone rings
and he goes down to answer it, kicking Sissel's body down on the way. </p>
<p class="style2">Jeego will inform whoever is on the other end that
it's done and then leave. Sissel doesn't have long to despair over the
woman's death as the desk lamp next to him proceeds to start speaking
to him. It turns out Mr Desk Lamp was in fact the voice speaking to him
earlier. After a brief conversation, the lamp informs him there is more
to learn about these "ghost tricks".</p>
<p class="style2">Read the dialogue bubble that pops up. Then enter the
Ghost World and make your way across the cores to the folding cot. The
desk lamp will quickly explain to you about the top screen. Exit the
Ghost World and manipulate the folding cot. Enter the Ghost World again
and move over to the lamp. After solving that puzzle, Sissel is
rewarded with a new power. The desk lamp will then invite him to
possess the woman's corpse. Go ahead.</p>
<p class="style2">It seems that the woman is unconscious. In the
meantime, we'll just go ahead and save her life.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>== 4 Minutes Before Death ==</strong></p>
<p class="style2"><strong>7:01pm, Zone D Waste Center</strong></p>
<p class="style2">On the upper level, our unlucky redhead is currently
shaking the body lying before her. The hitman turns up and we already
know how the rest of it goes. Fortunately, it seems that Sissel will be
able to change that using his ghost tricks.</p>
<p class="style2">Sissel will find himself all the way down on the
lower level and he'll have to make his way up to where the two.</p>
<p class="style2">Hop into the desk lamp, then move to the mannequin.
Jump to the tire and manipulate it, which will make the mannequin stand
upright. Return to the mannequin, move to the refrigerator then
manipulate it. A blender will fall out. Close the refrigerator door.
Move to the blender and turn it on, then jump over to the fan and
manipulate it. Quickly jump to the flag and Sissel will be lifted up to
the top level.</p>
<p class="style2">Jump to the bicycle. The last few seconds of the
woman's life will begin counting down. Before that happens, move to the
bike's bell and ring it. Jeego will turn to shoot it, giving her a
chance to run for it. Unfortunately, it seems the bridge is up, making
escape very difficult. Jump to the pedal and manipulate it. Next, go to
the lever and lower it. The crane will swing around. Go to the ladder
and extend it, then make your way to the claw holding the wrecking
ball. Open it.</p>
<p class="style2">This in turn causes the wrecking ball to fall...
right on top of the hitman. Needless to say, he's gone and the woman is
safe for now. </p>
<p class="style2">The alarming truth dawns on Sissel... he's actually
lost his memory and can't even remember who he is. The desk lamp is
back and introduces himself as Ray. He tells Sissel that he will
disappear when the day breaks. Before Sissel disappears however, he
wants to learn his lost story, right up until the moment of his death.
Ray suggests that he starts with the young woman who is currently
sneezing in the rain. </p>
<p class="style2"><strong>7:21pm</strong></p>
<p class="style2">Move to the bicycle and shimmy it. Go down to the
umbrella and open it. Read the woman's thought bubble. She will pick up
the umbrella and walk downstairs. A brief scene involving a cat
follows. </p>
<p class="style2"><strong>7:27pm</strong></p>
<p class="style2">(Good lord, just how long did it take to walk down
those stairs?!)</p>
<p class="style2">Read her thought bubble again. She will take a note
from Sissel's jacket and look at it. Jump over to the note and examine
it. The phone will ring before Sissel has a chance to read it and Lynne
will go to answer the phone. Ray will remind Sissel of when the phone
rang before - the call was for the hitman himself, meaning the person
on the other line may well be the one who ordered Sissel's murder. </p>
<p class="style2">Possess the telephone. After listening to the brief
conversation, Ray tells Sissel that he has the ability to possess
telephones and travel through phone lines. When the conversation is
over, select the number for the new location and you're off.</p>
<p class="style1">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>7:31pm</strong></p>
<p class="style2">Sissel arrives in a strange room to find two people -
a man with bushy eyebrows and his muscular servant. Sissel expresses
the desire to read the file the man is holding, so let's move over to
it. The man will close it before he can examine it, but that's okay
because Sissel can simply open it. Examine it again and it pops open,
giving the man a shock. The servant will reveal the woman's name -
Lynne, and then the file gets put away. Jump over to the projector and
manipulate it. Right as the painting turns around, jump into the ghost
world and possess its core.</p>
<p class="style2">The servant will bring up another face on the screen
- Sissel's. After a brief and cryptic conversation, Sissel will find
himself back by the table. Jump to the control panel and manipulate it.
This will bring the phone back up. At that moment, it rings and you'll
learn that Lynne is in danger again. Hop into the phone to see another
hitman on the end. His name is "One Step Ahead" Tengo and he is calling in
from Lynne's apartment to tell him... that she isn't there yet. Well,
it wouldn't be smart to go home right after an assassin tried to kill
you.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>7:42pm</strong></p>
<p class="style2">Our next destination is of course Lynne's apartment.
Head over there through the phone line. Tengo is not the only one in
the apartment, it seems. A little girl is tied up and a little dog is
lying dead nearby. It would be very bad if Lynne came home to a scene
like this, so it's time to try and fix this bad situation. Possess the
dog's corpse.</p>
<p class="style2">IT'S MISSILE! That is, the dog is a cute little
Pomeranian by the name of Missile and he feels bad because he couldn't
protect his lady, Miss Kamila. Let's help him out, shall we?</p>
<p class="style2">== <strong>4 Minutes Before Death</strong> ==</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>7:33pm, Maison de Amida- Room 701</strong></p>
<p class="style2">The last four minutes before the little dog's life
play out. Kamila
was unable to watch television since Missile's barking was irritating
the lady next door and decided to listen to music through headphones
while reading instead. She was blissfully unaware of Tengo storming
into the apartment and proceeding to shoot Missile in the face. Those
must be some incredible headphones, huh?</p>
<p class="style2">Jump into the folding umbrella and wait until Kamila
comes to get
the headphones. When she starts juggling them, extend the umbrella.
This action causes the headphones to land in the fish tank, preventing
her from being able to listen to her music. She will bring over the
cart. Roll the cart over to the other side of the room then rock the
bowl of donuts. Quickly move to the star ornament, then to the Santa
ornament. Jump down to the lamp, then the door. A rat will have come
over to examine the fallen donut. Open the door to send it flying
underneath the sofa. Missile will follow it under the sofa and start
barking. Kamila will then clamber underneath to join him.</p>
<p class="style2">At that moment, Tengo bursts into the room. Since
nobody appears to
be there, he sits himself down on the sofa and helps himself to the
donuts. Kamila may still be shaking in fear underneath the sofa, but at
least Missile's life has been saved. Sissel returns to the present and
waits to see what happens next. The phone rings and Tengo goes to
answer it, learning that Lynne is still at the junkyard. The hitman
leaves and Kamila and Missile emerge from under the sofa. The phone
suddenly rings yet again and Kamila answers it. Turns out it's Lynne
calling.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>7:49pm</strong></p>
<p class="style2">Make your way back to the cart. Sissel will notice
that the little
dog has a core. Reach out to the core and Sissel will have a
conversation with Missile. It turns out he can communicate with the
living once they have been saved from death. Roll the cart and jump
into the phone to listen in on the girls' conversation. Lynne warns
Kamila to get out of there and asks her to meet her at the Chicken
Kitchen. She also asks her to bring a wooden box, hidden in that very
room. Before Lynne can even tell her where it is, she ends up getting
freaked out by a pigeon. Kamila is also freaked out and drops the phone
in the tank. Oops. Now she has to look for the box but she's going to
need the help of a certain ghost.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>7:54pm</strong></p>
<p class="style2">Roll the cart across the room again. Jump up into the
Santa ornament
and make it spin faster. You will then be able to reach the latch. Open
it, and a wooden box in the ceiling will fall out. Return to the
ornament and make it spin slower to return to the star ornament on the
tree. Play the ornament to get Kamila's attention. She will notice the
box. Now that she has what she's looking for, it's time for her to
leave. Unfortunately for Sissel, leaving the apartment isn't going to
be so easy with the phone at the bottom of the fish tank.</p>
<p class="style1">Chapter 3</p>
<p><strong><span class="style4"><span class="style5">8:04pm<br>
</span></span>
</strong></p>
<span class="style4"><span class="style5">Now we have to find a way out
of this apartment. At least Missile can
be of some help. Operate the remote control and the star ornament. The
power of these two objects combined will cause Missile to bark so
energetically that the woman next door practically pounds the wall down
and creates a new path for Sissel. <br>
<br>
</span></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="style2">8:05pm</span><span
 class="style4"><span class="style5"><br>
<br>
Cross the room and possess the bottle that the lady set down on the
table. Sissel and Missile will exchange farewells then the little
doggie races off to go and make a new path for himself. <br>
<br>
Sissel is now in a new room, occupied by
the lady, Emma, and her sick
little
daughter, Amelie. After Emma has a talk with Amelie, she will sit down
to
type away at her typewriter. Sissel's objective is to get across the
room to that telephone.<br>
<br>
</span></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="style4"><span
 class="style5">8:06pm<br>
</span></span>
</span><span class="style4"><span class="style5"><br>
Go up to the latch in the ceiling and open it, then use the drinking
bird to knock the rat onto the shelf. Read Emma's thought bubble. She
will get up to find her dictionary. When she is coming to the bookcase,
manipulate the windmill to knock the rat to the floor. Emma will then
discover the dictionary. Possess the dictionary and she will carry it
over to the table.<br>
<br>
Listen to the conversation between Emma and Amelie. Emma will then
return to the table and start typing again. While she is typing, turn
the knob on the lamp and the light will go out. Emma will freak out
about making a typo and pull out the paper from the typewriter.
Immediately possess the paper she is holding and she will throw it
across the room to land on top of the wastebasket. If you don't manage
to jump to the phone in mid-air, simply lift the lid of the wastebasket
and try again. <br>
<br>
The second Sissel jumps into the phone, it rings. It's her husband,
asking her to return home to him. Emma is unwilling to do so unless he
changes his mind, it seems. The conversation comes to an end and we get
a new phone number, but there's no need to go over there at the moment.<br>
<br>
</span></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="style2">8:16pm</span><span
 class="style4"><span class="style5"><br>
<br>
Head to the junkyard. Two detectives and a medical examiner are now
present and they are looking into Sissel's murder. Lynne has been taken
into custody. Listen to the detectives' conversation. Then move closer
to the medical examiner and read his thought bubble. A moment later,
Inspector Cabanela turns up. He comes down and immediately makes a
phone call.<br>
<br>
</span></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="style2">8:18pm</span><span
 class="style4"><span class="style5"><br>
<br>
Jump into the phone to listen in. Cabanela gets a surprise when a
decidedly strange individual answers the phone, but the person he meant
to speak to quickly turns up. Seems the guy is performing a stake out
tonight. Anyway, after that phone call is over, Cabanela tells the
medical examiner to do his job well before asking where Lynne is. He
leaves to go and see her.<br>
<br>
</span></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="style2">8:19pm</span><span
 class="style4"><span class="style5"><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Listen to the detectives' conversation. <br>
<br>
</span></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="style2">8:20pm</span><span
 class="style4"><span class="style5"><br>
<br>
Listen to the medical examiner's thought bubble. He will put down the
gun that is suspected of being the murder weapon. Turns out it's the
same model that detectives use... and Lynne herself is a detective.
This isn't looking good.<br>
<br>
</span></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="style2">8:22pm</span><span
 class="style4"><span class="style5"><br>
<br>
Examine the pistol. Sissel fires it, getting a few angry reactions.
Seconds later, there's another gunshot and the phone rings right away.
Go to the phone. It's Inspector Cabanela, demanding the medical
examiner head up to the superintendent's office immediately. <br>
<br>
</span></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="style2">8:23pm</span><span
 class="style4"><span class="style5"><br>
<br>
Head to the superintendent's office through the phone. <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 4</span><br>
<br>
Cabanela is frantically shaking Lynne's body. The pigeon man from
before turns up and points out that it looks like she was shot from the
trash pile. He leaves after that and then the doctor arrives to examine
Lynne. Jump across the cores to possess Lynne's body. This time, she
wakes up and gets a little confused in the process. When that's sorted
out, Sissel and Lynne have a chat. It turns out Lynne doesn't know
Sissel after all. It appears that he called her out there to the
junkyard that night but of course he doesn't remember why. Now it's
time to go back and save Lynne again. Better get used to this...<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">== 4 Minutes Before Death ==</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">8:18pm, Maint. Building - Super's
Office</span><br>
<br>
Lynne was talking on the phone when a police came in, prompting her to
stuff her blindingly pink notebook behind the shelf. She claimed she
was hungry but stopped the officer from ordering chicken. Cabanela came
dancing into the office a moment later and, once the police officer was
gone, began talking to Lynne. He became aware of the sudden danger and
leaped to protect Lynne, but was too late to stop her from being hit by
the deadly bullet that came in through the window.<br>
<br>
Wait for Lynne to put her notebook behind the shelf, then move over to
the desk area. The officer will use the phone to order chicken. Don't
go through the phone line just yet. Instead, swivel the desk lamp then
turn it on so that it shines on the notebook. The officer will notice
it and make a call to the junkyard. Jump into the phone and when you
get the chance to, go there.<br>
<br>
Ray will introduce himself to Lynne, who seems oddly fixated on calling
him an old grandpa. The desk lamp talks about hearing the shot on the
upper level. The hitman is surely getting ready to shoot right now,
which means we had better hurry up there. You will have to do the next
steps fairly quickly... not too quickly, just get to the top before
Inspector Cabanela does, which isn't difficult. Make your way over to
the folding cot and fold it, then jump to the flag. Manipulate the
blender and fan, then ride up on the flag like you did before. Hop up
onto the searchlight and wait for Inspector Cabanela to come along on
his bike. When the bike is close enough, quickly jump into the Ghost
World and possess it. Cabanela will unknowingly escort you over to the
far side of the junkyard where you need to be.<br>
<br>
Jump to the rear door of the van. At that moment, Tengo will pop up and
ready his gun. Open the rear door, move to the searchlight and turn it
on. Tengo will be startled by the light and dive done. He will now move
to another spot to take care of Lynne. Lower the rear door and wait for
the patrolman to come over then possess his nightstick. As the
patrolman walks over to the police car, Tengo appears again. Quickly
jump into the ghost world (the patrolman will not wait for you to get
off) and move to the police car's flashing light. Do not touch the
searchlight above Tengo, as this will turn the far right searchlight
off. Instead, turn on the flashing light, which will scare Tengo off
and bring the other patrolman over.<br>
<br>
Jump to the left patrolman's nightstick and wait for him to walk to the
far left searchlight. Jump to it and turn it off, then return to the
nightstick. When the patrolman walks back to the police car, turn on
the middle searchlight. Go back to the nightstick and the patrolman
will walk to the crossing gate again. Go to the crossing gate and raise
it. Move up to the hook. Tengo will emerge on top of the pile, just
beneath those very heavy crates that you can conveniently drop. Lower
the hook and you will put an end to yet another hitman's life.<br>
<br>
Sissel and Lynne exchange farewells. Of course, this isn't going to be
the last they will see of each other... Sissel returns to the present
and decides to go and see how she's doing.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">8:31pm</span><br>
<br>
Move down to the umbrella and open it. It will carry you down to the
lower level. Head over to the phone. Sissel and Ray have a brief chat.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">8:32pm</span><br>
<br>
Go to the Super's Office.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 5</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">8:34pm</span><br>
<br>
The police officer is getting a scolding for letting Lynne out of his
sight. It seems that the lady detective has mysteriously vanished,
apparently not all too keen on getting arrested. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">8:35pm</span><br>
<br>
Roll the step ladder to the other end of the room and listen to the
conversation between the detective and officer.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">8:36pm</span><br>
<br>
Roll the step ladder back, which gets the officer's attention. Swivel
the desk lamp and shine it on the notebook again. The detective will
notice what the officer is doing and head over. After looking in the
notebook, he makes a call. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">8:38pm</span><br>
<br>
Jump into the phone and listen in.Turns out the person Lynne was
calling is an officer named Bailey. It seems Lynne didn't say anything
particularly special, so the detective quickly ends the call. He will
then leave.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">8:39pm</span><br>
<br>
Head through the phone line to the new number you received. Sissel
finds himself in a room with two police officers. Bailey will pin a
memo up on the wall. Possess the memo and let it loose. Bailey's
workmate will ask about the memo then toss it back across the room into
the wastebasket. The phone rings. Jump into the phone and you'll find
out it's Lynne calling. She asks to speak to "him" but Bailey won't
allow her to. Lynne requests he keep quiet about the phone call then
hangs up. Bailey is about to call the detective division on her anyway
but his workmate stops him. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">8:49pm</span><br>
<br>
Go through the phone line to the new number.<br>
<br>
Oh, <span style="font-style: italic;">Lynne</span>. Turns out she's
dead again already. The pigeon man will stumble upon her corpse and the
police officer comes running. He is mystified to see that she
apparently died in a room with no exits and heads off to find a real
detective. So how did Lynne manage to die in this "locked room"? We'll
see by possessing Lynne's corpse. Lynne is awfully cheerful about dying
yet again. Seriously, what is wrong with that girl? She would really
like to know who shot her. Time to find out by going back to four
minutes before her death.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">== 4 Minutes Before Death ==</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">8:44pm, Maint. Building - Basement</span><br>
<br>
Lynne had just finished her call to Bailey when she decided to listen
in on the pigeon man in the next room. When he came to the door, she
quickly jumped into the mini elevator. After the pigeon guy answered a
call and went upstairs, Lynne was able to go into the room and flipped
on the switch. This proved to be a big mistake as it set a murderous
contraption in motion. Lynne noticed the gun too late and got shot
again.<br>
<br>
When the pigeon guy comes to the door, jump into the lamp then to the
phone. It will ring and the pigeon man picks it up. Go over there to
get to the upper floor. Jump to the kettle and close the lid. The
police officer will lift the kettle up and lower it to the floor. From
there, jump down to the motor and possess the ball. Lynne will come
into the room and flip the switch. Do the next steps quickly. Jump to
the toy cake then the trapdoor, open the trapdoor, jump back to the
ball and then to the toolbox. When the ball is on the floor,
immediately open the toolbox. <br>
<br>
The tennis ball goes flying and hits the Cupid, causing it to fire its
arrow in the opposite direction. It lights the candle on the cake and
fires party poppers. A murderous contraption that could also be a
birthday surprise? Very strange. Sissel returns to the present where
Lynne is still in the room and she calls out to him.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">8:57pm</span><br>
<br>
Touch the core in Lynne's body to speak to her. Lynne has decided to
share a little information with him, but won't tell him much about the
case she's working on, just that she believes the person is innocent.
They discuss some other subjects including who shot Sissel. Lynne
doesn't remember that part very well at all despite being there. Seeing
as Lynne's a suspect and a target, Sissel offers to help her but she
doesn't seem to want it. Lynne is going to the restaurant now but
hearing how hopeless Sissel is right now, she realises they might need
each other after all and so they make an agreement. Lynne asks for a
favour - she wants Sissel to sneak into the prison and read the work
schedule of a prisoner, D99. Lynne then heads off to the Chicken
Kitchen.<br>
<br>
<span class="style6">Chapter 6</span><br>
<br>
<strong>9:03pm</strong><br>
<br>
Now we're going to head back to the prison. Go up to the phone (move
the hoist to get to the motor) and head to the uniformed men's office.
Bailey and his workmate are discussing preparations, but for what? <br>
<br>
<strong>9:06pm<br>
<br>
</strong>Let loose the memos that Bailey puts on the walls and read the
conversations that follow between him and his workmate. Sissel will
learn about the three different prisoners- the rock star who sang
national secrets that he couldn't possibly have known, the man who
burst into the commissioner's officer with a flamethrower and the man
who shot his wife dead in front of a family member. The third one is
the prisoner whose work schedule we're going to look at. After learning
all that, the rock star will come into the next room and use the phone.
Bailey's workmate will set his glass down on his house of cards.
<br>
<br>
<strong>9:09pm</strong><br>
<br>
If you haven't already done so, jump over to the emergency switch on
the other side of the room (there's already another memo on the wall if
you haven't) Raise the emergency switch. Jump to the glass and go over
to the next room. Press the switch by the door, quickly possess the
door and when it's slid open, possess the guitar. Examine the guitar.
After Sissel makes some comments, the rock star finishes his phone call
and takes the guitar back to his cell. <br>
<br>
<strong>9:12pm<br>
</strong><br>
Might as well take a look at his blackboard while we're here. Jump over
to the blackboard and examine it. Oh dear... it turns out Sissel can't
read. Now how is he supposed to be able to read Prisoner D99's work
schedule? We'll worry about that when we get there. For now, we'll
focus on getting to his cell. Leave the cell by following the cores to
the right. Press the emergency button above the phone. This gets a
couple of prisoners moving and their movements will be very important
in getting to D99's cell.<br>
<br>
Go back into the rock star's cell and possess the notepaper with the
"O" on it while waiting for the alarm to stop. The rock star will take
it off the wall and flush it away, sending Sissel down to another cell.
Ring the bell to call back the prisoner. If you're quick enough, you
can possess the spoon while he's emerging from the hole. Your goal is
the bunk at the other side of the room and you can use the spoon to get
over there.<br>
<br>
Now we can get to Prisoner D99's cell. Go to the cell where D99 is
currently busy painting. Extend the picture frame and hop over to the
blackboard. Sissel's inability to read doesn't turn out to be an issue
after all as the blackboard is blank. It's time to go back and report
to Lynne. Go to the picture frame and close it. At that moment, D99's
dinner will arrive.<br>
<br>
The guard asks why he killed his wife, but he doesn't answer. Next, the
guard asks about the painting. He responds that he's painting all the
faces he doesn't want to forget and this is the last of those faces. He
steps away from the easel... revealing a portrait of Sissel.<br>
<br>
<strong>9:42pm</strong><br>
<br>
Go to the phone and head back to the guard room. A call comes in from
the chief of police, asking about the status. Cabanela is there and
asks about Lynne. Bailey confesses about the call he received earlier.<br>
<br>
<strong>9:49pm<br>
<br>
</strong>Go to the new number through the phone. Sissel arrives at the
chief of police's office. Seems that Cabanela is concerned about
waiting for someone to show up at a Point X, though there's not much
time left. In other news, it seems almost certain that Lynne may have
been the one to kill Sissel. Raise the antenna and lower the screen.
Read the conversation and Cabanela will produce evidence of the crime
that happened in the junkyard. <br>
<br>
<strong>9:51pm</strong><br>
<br>
Operate the remote control and Sissel will view the recording of his
own death. There's no question about it. Lynne is clearly shown taking
her gun out and shooting him on the tape. The chief of police is
mystified about one thing. How did Sissel end up on the lower level
when he died at the top? The hitman certainly didn't kick him down
after getting flattened by a wrecking ball. Turns out the answer is on
the tape. A black cat popped out of the bag Sissel was holding and
knocked his body down before walking off.<br>
<br>
A call comes in over the radio. It's the detective from the park,
reporting that Lynne just turned up at Point X. Cabanela orders him to
get Lynne away from there and hold on to her. Moments later, a loud
noise comes over the radio and the detective is no longer answering.
Cabanela picks up the phone to make a call to Point X.<br>
<br>
<strong>10:01pm</strong><br>
<br>
Go to the phone. The Chicken Kitchen chef is on the other end and seems
awfully distressed about something. He hangs up pretty quickly. Instead
of going to Point X, Cabanela goes off somewhere else. Sissel will go
on ahead to the Chicken Kitchen.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">10:05pm</span><br>
<br>
Something very bad has happened over at the Chicken Kitchen. A van is
sticking through the restaurant window and the driver is dead. Lynne is
nowhere in sight. Roll the tire over and enter the Ghost World. Oh...
there she is. Underneath that giant chicken, no less. You know the
drill. Possess her corpse yet again.<br>
<br>
Sissel and Lynne discuss the subjects of Sissel's killer and the
blackboard. Lynne is incredibly shocked to learn that she apparently
shot him, as she really doesn't remember. She doesn't believe she would
have done it before she got the information but Sissel points out it
could have been after, as Lynne appeared really surprised on the tape.
Neither of them have any idea what he told her though. When Sissel
tells her about the blackboard, Lynne has a freakout. It turns out the
blackboard being blank means the prisoner is about to be executed.
Lynne talks about how the prisoner, Detective Jowd, could never have
killed his own wife and she's determined to solve this case before it's
too late. Lastly, Lynne reveals why she chose to come to the Chicken
Kitchen- the note Sissel had said "The Chicken Kitchen, 10:00"<br>
<br>
After all that, Lynne wonders what Sissel is going to do next. She
points out he could easily get revenge by not saving her. But Sissel
feels he hasn't solved his mystery just yet - he still doesn't know who
he is and why he was killed. So now he's going to save her. <br>
<br>

 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">10:00pm, The Chicken Kitchen</span><br>
<br>
Lynne was sitting in the restaurant and waiting for her chicken to
arrive. While she sat there pining for chicken, the waitress delivered
a chicken to a mysterious blue couple upstairs. Suddenly, an out of
control van came hurtling toward the restaurant. Lynne ran to push the
waitress out of the way and did an impressive backflip out of the van's
way, only to get crushed by the falling giant chicken above her.<br>
<br>
Go to the bell on Lynne's table and ring it three times very quickly.
The waitress, Memry, will come with a pitcher of water. Possess the
pitcher and she'll take it back across the room. Next, possess her cart
and she'll take it into the elevator. When you're on the upper floor,
possess the blue couple's trunk. While Memry's leaving, a dialog bubble
pops up. Read it. Beauty and Dandy will discuss the strange cases at
the Special Prison (which is suspicious, considering those cases are
supposed to be top secret) Beauty will suddenly sense someone is
listening and the couple will move to the table at the back. Now they
are too far away for Sissel and Lynne to hear them.<br>
<br>
Not a problem. Simply wait for the bartender to put the glass down,
then move to the bell and ring it. Memry will come to talk to the
bartender. While she's there, dispense from the bottle dispenser. The
glass falls down and breaks, causing Memry to notice the trunk. When
the bartender puts down another glass, go to possess the trunk. Dandy
will come to get it and take it over to the table. Move to the light
and read the dialog bubble that comes up. Beauty will find a bug on the
chicken and set fire to it. The van comes crashing into the restaurant
and the chains on the chicken will break. As it comes toward you, swing
the light and possess the core on the chicken. It will turn around and
drop even lower. Possess the flashing light on the vehicle then possess
the driver's corpse.<br>
<br>
The driver is still unconscious. If we can erase his death, Lynne's
will also be erased, so let's go and save this poor guy.<br>
<br>

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">9:59pm, Temsik Park</span><br>
<br>
Detective Rindge was watching the Chicken Kitchen when he saw Lynne
turn up. He was about to radio it in when the phone rang. After talking
to the person on the phone, he talked to the Chief then set off in his
van toward the restaurant. While he was driving, he listened to a bug
through his headphones, hearing the same conversation Sissel and Lynne
heard just minutes earlier. When Beauty destroyed the bug, it emitted a
high pitched noise that knocked Rindge unconscious and made the van
crash.<br>
<br>
When Rindge throws the binoculars into the van, recline the seat twice
to bring the binoculars over, then turn on the flashing light. Rindge
comes over to turn it off and notices the binoculars. Quickly possess
them and he'll take them over to the phone. Jump into the phone.<br>
<br>
It's Memry, and she thinks planting a bug on the blue couple's chicken
is a really good idea. But we know otherwise by now, don't we? Go there
and Sissel and Lynne find themselves in The Chicken Kitchen's kitchen.<br>
<br>
Memry will begin inserting the bug into the chicken. At one point, she
complains about it being smoky and goes to turn on the switch that
activates the fans. Wait for the chef to set down a second chicken,
then turn off the switch and make your way to the chef's hat (scrunch
and stretch the t-shirt to get across). When the hat falls down,
possess the pedal below. Don't touch it just yet. Memry will complain
about the smoke again and go to switch on the fans. While her back is
turned, operate the pedal. The two chickens will be swapped and Memry
will take the bug free chicken to the couple.<br>
<br>
Rindge will be treated to the chef's singing instead and won't crash
the van. Now that Lynne's escaped the fate of being "hammered by her
horrible hen", it's time to return to the new present where Lynne will
tell Sissel about the case she's working on.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">10:45pm</span><br>
<br>
Head through the phone to The Chicken Kitchen. Rindge is there, sitting
at Lynne's table while she happily gobbles down the giant chicken in
front of her.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">10:46pm</span><br>
<br>
Go to the bell and ring three times, then possess the pitcher as Memry
comes. While you have the chance, move over to the bell on Lynne's
table. On the way, Sissel will notice that Rindge doesn't have a core.
Memry leaves and Rindge tries to persuade Lynne to slip out, but she
can't because she's meant to be meeting Kamila there. Go and talk to
Lynne.<br>
<br>
Lynne is very satisfied with her chicken, but that aside... it's time
to hear about the case. Lynne tells Sissel that Jowd is her hero- ten
years ago, she was taken hostage in the park and Jowd saved her. That
experience was what led to her becoming a detective. She refuses to
believe he could possibly have murdered his wife and wants to prove him
innocent. Lynne then talks about a deal that's set to go down at this
restaurant, a deal that could affect the future of their nation. The
couple upstairs are waiting for the other party in their deal to show
up... who might just be Sissel himself. Only Inspector Cabanela knows
the details. She talks about Inspector Cabanela and how he was good
friends with Detetctive Jowd. They then discuss Kamila and the music
box. The box was a present from Jowd, who must have sent it right
before he was arrested.<br>
<br>
The conversation ends and Lynne has finished her chicken. Rindge asks
if the case she's looking into is Jowd's then tells her he's being
executed but of course she already knows and she thinks she still has
time since the executions are usually carried out at dawn. Not this
time though. The execution is set for 11pm and can only be stopped with
a stay of execution from the Justice Minister. Lynne tells Sissel to
stop the execution before racing off to see the Justice Minister. <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 8</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">10:55pm</span><br>
<br>
Sissel arrives at the guards' office. The lights are out and Bailey is
in a panic. A call comes in and the other guard answers it. It's
Special Detention calling from the death chamber to let them know the
internal phone is back up. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">10:59pm</span><br>
<br>
Go through the phone to Special Detention. Read the bubbles and enter
the Ghost World. Sissel comments on the fact darkness doesn't really
exist in the Ghost World. Now go over to the room to the right. Possess
the light and wait for water to form on the ceiling. Possess the water
and Sissel will fall down into the bucket. Open the nearby toolbox and
the guard finds his wrench. He manages to get the generator running and
the lights come back on.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">11:04pm</span><br>
<br>
Possess the grounding sphere on the generator and ride up. When the
water forms on the ceiling again, jump across to the light. Return to
the other room and read the bubbles again. It turns out Detective Jowd
has already been executed but that's not really a problem. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">11:06pm</span><br>
<br>
Return to the right room and manipulate the power supply. Some lights
will come on. Go back and read the conversation between the guards,
then manipulate the lever. The chair will let off some shocks and the
guard goes flying back. Possess the wrench he's holding. He'll return
to the chair. Possess the water droplets and go up to the head piece.
Rock it and it falls off. The other guard tosses it onto the cart. Rock
the cart then follow the new path to the phone.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">11:08pm</span><br>
<br>
Possess Jowd's corpse. He doesn't remember much at first and doesn't
really care, but soon recalls a few things. He doesn't remember who
Sissel is though. Never mind, we'll just go back and save him from his
execution.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">== 4 Minutes Before Death ==</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">10:46pm, Special Prison Cell Block</span><br>
<br>
Jowd was in his cell, still eating that chicken he got about two hours
ago (He took two hours to finish it?) The guards came to take him to
the death chamber and flipped the lever to test the chair. It had a
short out and exploded, killing Jowd in the process.<br>
<br>
First thing to do is escape the death chamber. The phone will ring and
the guard answers it but don't go just yet. A second call will come and
then you can go over there. You will be in the cells. Head over to the
clogged note in the rock star's toilet and open it up. The rock star
will flush it down to Sausage Head's cell. Use the spoon to get into
Jowd's cell. Go to the wastebasket. When Jowd holds his napkin over it,
open up the wastebasket and the ketchup can goes flying to make a red
mark on the napkin. Possess the napkin and Jowd will flush it.<br>
<br>
It will be picked up by Sausage Head. Possess his spoon and he'll go
down to dig. Follow the path down and go to the lever in the next room.
Manipulate it and the chair explodes... with nobody in the room. Now
the execution can't be carried out for the time being. Since the
power's out, the cell bars have opened automatically. Now would be a
good time for Jowd to make his escape from prison.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 9</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">11:13pm</span><br>
<br>
Go back the way you came until you reach Sausage Head's spoon. The
toilet bell rings and Sausage Head goes up. A guard wearing goggles
emerges from the darkness and spots him. The prisoner is taken away. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">11:14pm</span><br>
<br>
Head left into Jowd's cell. Sissel sees a "hunter" in the darkness
whose eyes seem to glow red. He's not kidding when he says escape isn't
going to be easy, but we'll get to that in a minute. Jowd is underneath
his bunk. Talk to him. Sissel and Jowd work on an escape strategy. A
button will appear in the top right corner to call Jowd to wherever you
are. <br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">11:16pm</span><br>
<br>
For now, just focus on getting Jowd to the bunk in the next cell. Wait
until the guard next to him is looking away before calling him over to
the bunk. Possess the bulletproof vest on the other guard and hitch a
ride to the other side of the cell. Go up and open the hatch to drop
the guard in the ceiling.<br>
<br>
The next part is more complicated. You can call Jowd over to the stairs
and get him in the ceiling from there, or have him go straight to the
ceiling from the bunk. My personal strategy is to close the hatch
again, then ring the toilet bell while one guard is in the cell. It
will get his attention. Keep ringing it while the other guard is going
upstairs. Once he's walked past the top hatch, open the hatch and call
Jowd to the valve. If done right, he will climb into the ceiling
without getting shot. The hard part is over!<br>
<br>
Close the hatch again and go over to the cell above Jowd's (the rock
star's cell) Call him to the guitar. Play the drum to get the guard's
attention and open the hatch. The guard falls through. Call Jowd to the
guitar again then close the hatch for him when he asks. Lastly, call
him to the bunk. <br>
<br>
It looks like we've successfully made it. The lights come back on and
the cell bars slam shut. Whew, that was close. Sissel suggests Jowd go
to see Lynne. Jowd runs off.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">11:28pm</span><br>
<br>
Go to the phone and head to the guards' office. A call comes in. It's
Jowd and he wants Sissel to come over immediately. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">11:31pm</span><br>
<br>
Go on through the phone line to the new number. Jowd is there in a
courtyard and he's not alone. Cabanela is pointing a gun at his back.
Talk to Jowd. Before he gets taken away, Sissel would like to ask him
about himself. However, Jowd can't talk about that right now because he
doesn't know Sissel's true face and can't talk about what he isn't sure
of. He suggests Sissel look at what's inside the music box he gave
Lynne. They talk about Cabanela, and then the execution. Jowd was
sentenced to death for the murder of his wife, Alma, but he also feels
responsible for another death. Ten years ago, when Lynne was taken
hostage, he drew his gun and he was going to shoot the man who took her
hostage. The man died.<br>
<br>
After that, Jowd makes one more call to the justice minister. Lynne is
there and seems to be awfully troubled about something. Cabanela gives
Jowd a pocket watch as a gift then the two of them leave. Sissel can no
longer help Jowd so he goes to the justice minister's office to help
Lynne out. <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 10</span><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">11:41pm</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Sissel arrives at the office where Lynne is half hidden behind a desk,
frantically shaking a corpse. Talk to her. Turns out the corpse is that
of the justice minister. Sissel talks to Lynne about what's been
happening since they last saw each other. She can't believe Cabanela
was the one to arrest Jowd during his escape. Possess the minister's
corpse. He's still unconscious so Sissel rewinds time to see what
happened.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">== 4 Minutes Before Death ==</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">11:31pm, Minister's Office</span><br>
<br>
The justice minister was working at his desk when a call came in. He
appeared to be very upset by it and tried to call his wife but she
wouldn't answer. Then he suffered what appeared to be a heart attack
and reached for his medicine, but it went flying across the room. Next,
he tried to reach for the water but the jug fell to the floor. With
neither medicine nor water, the justice minister fell over dead.<br>
<br>
Go into the phone and it will ring. It's Beauty and she's informing him
that she has his daughter. The conditions for his daughter's release?
Ensure that the execution of Jowd happens tonight. Don't go over there.<br>
<br>
Wait until the seconds of his life begin counting down and go to the
flag. When he reaches for the jug, it will wobble on the side of the
desk for a moment. Quickly flap the flag to knock it back, then possess
the jug. When the minister lifts it up to drink, possess the fan. The
justice minister recovers but he isn't out of the woods yet. Manipulate
the fan and possess the papers that come flying up. Sissel will be
carried over to the other side of the room. Time to get the minister's
medicine to him.<br>
<br>
Raise the armor's arm, turn the hanging basket, undo the frame hanger.
Go back down, lowering the armor's arm. Close the curtain. Raise the
right armor's arm, turn the globe stand. Spin the globe and it falls
out, knocking down the urn. Undo the frame hanger and the frame will
fall down. Roll the globe and it falls down as well. Go to the curtain
and close it, then raise the left armor's arm. Rock the hanging basket
(use the top core, not the bottom one) Now the globe is impaled on the
sword. Go to the sword and swing it. The globe ends up knocking the
medicine all the way over to the minister's desk. The minister ends up
taking way too much medicine but at least he's alive now. Sissel
returns to the present.<br>
<br>
The justice minister is alive but looks deeply troubled. The cause of
this would be Lynne, apparently. She's trying to get him to call off
the execution but he isn't willing to listen to her, even when she says
she might be able to gather new evidence in the case. He notifies her
that Jowd just escaped and the execution will be carried out when he's
caught.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">11:55pm</span><br>
<br>
Swing the sword to get Lynne's attention. Sissel tells her about the
kidnapping. Lynne carries him across the room. Read the dialogue
bubble. Lynne gives the justice minister another heart attack. Good
going, Lynne. At least he doesn't die again.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">12:09am</span><br>
<br>
Go to the phone number you got when saving the justice minister.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 11</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">12:10am</span><br>
<br>
Sissel arrives at the kidnappers' hideout. Dandy arrives with the trunk
in tow and Beauty leaves for a little while. Dandy sits down and falls
asleep. Now we have to get to the trunk. There's something very strange
about this room. It resembles that contraption in the basement of the
super's office, but why? We'll find out later. Go to the candle and
make it burn brighter. Jump to the decoration that came down and swing
it. It will get stuck on the fan. Jump to the fan's motor then
manipulate it. A ball goes rolling off the table. Jump to the door and
manipulate it, which makes the ball roll away.<br>
<br>
Return to the decoration on the fan and go to the other side. Lower the
shade and jump to the crate. Sissel will notice the trunk is too far
for him to reach. Go left until you reach the party poppers and set
them both off. Go back to the fan's motor and manipulate it. Quickly
return to the candle and manipulate that too. The streamer on the fan
will catch fire and light the doll's candle. Head to the balance toy
and spin it. The other streamers burn up, lighting the candlestick on
the wall. Move to the candle sconce and move it. The shelf's cords
breaks and
the clock falls down. Go to the clock, then the trunk and open it.<br>
<br>
Huh? There's a little girl inside the trunk but it's actually Kamila.
How strange. Beauty returns and talks to Dandy. Kamila asks if she's
been kidnapped and gets upset when Dandy calls the surroundings
miserable and filthy (but they are) because she used to live there.
Turns out it was the other party in the deal who chose that place.
Dandy leaves to go and get Beauty her bread and milk.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">12:21am</span><br>
<br>
Jump into the Ghost World and Sissel sees that Kamila has a core of the
dead. Talk to her. Sissel introduces himself. It seems Kamila doesn't
remember dying too well, so he decides not to press her on that
subject. It turns out Kamila got kidnapped on the way to the Chicken
Kitchen when going through the park and she left the music box there.
Sissel asks about her father. It turns out her father is not the
justice minister... but Detective Jowd. Five years ago, something
terrible happened. Kamila was left at home alone while her parents were
out working and built a contraption to surprise her mother, since it
was her birthday. Something went wrong and it set off the gun on the
wall, killing her mother. Jowd ended up taking the blame for what
happened to protect his daughter.<br>
<br>
They stop talking and Sissel assures her he'll save her, but then Dandy
returns and Beauty tells him they have to leave immediately. She can
sense Sissel and warns him that if she senses him again, the child will
die. Kamila drops the book Sissel is possessing when Dandy closes the
trunk and he's left behind in the house, unable to do anything to help
her further. <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 12</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">12:25am</span><br>
<br>
Sissel has returned to the justice minister's office where Lynne is
giving the justice minister a hard time. Sissel tells her about what he
found out at the hideout. The justice minister is still unwilling to
even believe anything he hears, whether it's Sissel being a ghost or
the kidnapping victim not really being his daughter. He can't even call
home to check because his wife won't answer and he can't send the
police over. Anyway, the hostage is still in danger, whether it's his
daughter or not.<br>
<br>
At that moment, Cabanela turns up, with Jowd in tow. He thought the
justice minister would like to see the escaped prisoner so he brought
him into the office. Lynne starts apologising for being unable to do
anything and is deeply upset. Read the dialog bubble. Lynne talks to
Cabanela, who doesn't seem to really believe Jowd is innocent. She gets
mad at him, believing that he only brought Jowd in to brag about his
accomplishment and lays into him about the rumours surrounding him.
Jowd comes forward and tries to tell her this is how it should be. Jump
across the cores to talk to Jowd.<br>
<br>
Sissel and Lynne talk to Jowd about the kidnapping and reveal it was in
fact his own daughter who was kidnapped. Sissel then repeats to Jowd
what Kamila told him about the murder five years ago. Sissel gives Jowd
a brief lecture about mistakenly believing Kamila's pain will be eased.
Now that the truth is out, Jowd talks about that day. Two very strange
things happened involving the contraption. The gun was an antique that
he had on display for years and wasn't part of the original design.
Then there was the movement of the Cupid. It was supposed to fire its
arrow without turning around. He made some adjustments to the scene,
including replacing the gun with a painting, and turned himself in. The
gun was put inside a certain music box. Tonight, Jowd learned of the
powers of the dead and found a new explanation on what happened that
day. The powers of the dead must have been responsible for what went on
in that room.<br>
<br>
Now that they know someone else was responsible for that death, Lynne
is determined to solve the case and Jowd has come round at last. Now
he's willing to be saved from execution. Lynne hurries off to Temsik
Park to get the gun.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">12:35am</span><br>
<br>
Read the dialog bubble. Cabanela is quite puzzled about what's going
on. Jowd replies he can't simply sit back while his daughter's been
kidnapped. Since it seems he's determined to be proven innocent now,
Cabanela asks the justice minister what he'll do. Since the minister
still doesn't believe his daughter is safe, he asks for Jowd to be
returned to prison and the execution to be carried out. Cabanela asks
one of the minister's servants to send for a prison van. Before the van
gets here, we have to get the justice minister to realise his daughter
hasn't been kidnapped.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">12:49am</span><br>
<br>
Head over to the lady's red apt. through the phone. The justice
minister's daughter is safe and sound in bed, coughing. <br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">12:51am</span><br>
<br>
Amelie is coughing furiously and it seems her fever has gotten even
worse. She went out earlier to go and buy her father a lighter for his
birthday when her fever went down. Amelie wants to call her father to
wish him a happy birthday, but Emma is unwilling. We'll have to help
Amelie call her father. Possess the lighter and light it. The phone
falls down on Amelie's bed but before she can phone her father, Emma
catches her and throws the phone up onto the top shelf where she can't
reach. Looks like it's not going to be that easy.<br>
<br>
Go up to the ceiling latch and turn it. The rat falls out and dangles
on the pendulum. Make the wall clock chime. Emma notices the rat and
hits it back into the ceiling. Turn the valve the rat landed on and it
gets electrocuted. The lights end up going out and Emma goes to bring
down the chandelier, which she lights and winds up. Now, go to the
crank at the left side of the room and turn it. The chandelier falls
down again. Emma will go to wind it back up. When she's walking back,
turn the crank again. If you get the timing right, Emma should end up
trapped in the chandelier.<br>
<br>
Turn the crank to pull the chandelier and Emma up. Turn the latch above
her and the rat's tail dangles over the edge. Next, make the chandelier
burn brighter. This causes the poor rat's tail to catch on fire and it
runs across the ceiling, falling out the other hole in the ceiling. Now
go to the pendulum and swing harder. The rat's tail actually lights the
candlestick, which burns the thin cords on the nearby shelf. The phone
falls down next to Amelie. Since Emma is trapped, Amelie is free to
call her father without any interruption and does so. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">12:56am</span><br>
<br>
Go to the phone and listen in on the conversation. After that's over,
Amelie has a conversation with her mother. Now that things have been
sorted out, Sissel returns to the minister's office. The minister will
give his thanks now that he's learned his daughter is safe. Talk to
him. He's finally willing to admit that ghosts do exist and the thanks
were meant for Sissel. The justice minister tells him they have known
about the powers of the dead for a while now though they didn't know it
was the power of ghosts. They were aware of the existence of a
"manipulator" - someone who could control others, and this manipulator
was responsible for the cases at the Special Prison. <br>
<br>
The minister confesses the truth about the time he signed the execution
order. He was actually manipulated into doing it and the experience
traumatised him so much that he couldn't tell anyone. He told his wife
however and she ended up moving out because he wouldn't call off the
execution. The minister then reveals the truth behind those powers to
Cabanela. Cabanela is stunned to hear it's all the work of a ghost and
quickly leaves to attend to some urgent business. The phone rings and
the minister answers. It's Lynne, calling from the park, and she wants
Sissel to head over immediately.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">1:28am</span><br>
<br>
Go through the phone to the park.<br>
<br>
<span class="style6">Chapter 14</span><br>
<br>
Lynne is waiting in the park when Sissel arrives and she doesn't seem
very happy. Follow the cores to the left and manipulate the swing to
make it go faster. Jump to the basketball inside the globe and then
spin the globe to get across to the seesaw. Make your way over to
Lynne. Talk to her. She didn't find what she was looking for, but found
something else. Lynne then points out the corpse lying nearby. Possess
the corpse.<br>
<br>
It's that strange young man who answered Cabanela's phone call ages ago
and he invites Sissel to come study his pamphlets... not that Sissel
could anyway, if he wanted to. There are more important things to do
right now like saving his life.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">== 4 Minutes Before Death ==</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">8:25pm, Temsik Park</span><br>
<br>
The reckless youth was left alone when Rindge went into the restroom
and heard a scream. It was Kamila being kidnapped. He raced over to the
scene and picked up the music box when Kamila shoved it into the
bushes. Kamila pushed Dandy away and the blue man landed on top of a
lever, pulling it down. A giant rock came falling down from above and
came perilously close to crushing Kamila before moving through the air
and crushing the youth instead.<br>
<br>
The reckless youth identifies the rock as Mino, the mascot of the park,
but Sissel's more interested in the way it moved aside. The youth
declares the gods saved the little girl... and then mischeviously
crushed him instead. Okay. Sissel thinks it might be someone with ghost
tricks more powerful than his though. Yeah, that makes more sense. Jump
into the Ghost World and Sissel sees another flame besides his. Go and
talk to it.<br>
<br>
IT'S MISSILE! Yes, the little dog is dead again and this time he has
the powers of the dead. He finally caught up with Kamila in the park
and went running after her but then Dandy came along on his moped,
hitting Missile. Missile fell into the crater and died there. When he
woke up, Kamila was already dead. Mino had crushed her. Missile went
back to four minutes before her death. Follow the little tutorial and
you'll learn how Missile used his powers of swapping to save Kamila. He
tried to swap Mino agan with a nearby object so that the youth wouldn't
have to die but couldn't reach. Now that Sissel's here, they may have a
chance of saving him.<br>
<br>
As Sissel, go to the dumpster lid and lift it then continue over to the
far end of the seesaw by the globe climber. Have Missile swap the
baseball with the basketball. The youth will come along and start
spinning on the globe. While he's doing that, have Sissel move to the
center of the globe and spin it faster. Go up the tree to the love
letter and rustle it loose. Go across the tree to the umbrella and
close it then open it again. The youth will run across the seesaw and
the umbrella catches the basketball. Have Missile swap the basketball
with the tire on the ground. This will cause the rugby ball to fall out
of the tree. When Mino falls down, swap it with the rugby ball. <br>
<br>
The youth gets knocked unconscious by the rugby ball but at least he's
alive. Sissel offers to save Missile, but Missile would rather hold
onto his ghost tricks since he's more useful with them. Sissel asks the
youth to give Lynne the music box when they return to the present then
he goes back. In the present, Missile speaks to Lynne before being
blown away on the wind. The youth wakes up and approaches Lynne to
present her with a pamphlet. Sissel reminds him about the music box and
he hands it over to her. The reckless youth is suddenly struck silent
and then asks if Lynne is the little girl from that time in the park,
ten years ago.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">1:35am</span><br>
<br>
Talk to the reckless youth. He talks about the "rock of the gods" that
he's so fascinated with. It's a meteorite that fell down in the park
ten years ago on the day of the kidnapping and showed a "miracle". The
youth was passing through the park on that day when he heard the scream
of a little girl. He saw the hostage situation take place before him
and noticed the meteorite fall down. One of its shards pierced the
man's back, killing him. Ever since that day, the meteorite, named
Temsik after the park, has lain at the bottom of the crater and the
youth believes the gods were responsible for saving Lynne. Lynne had no
idea about what happened since she was so traumatised by the experience
that she avoided the news. The youth swore to protect the park and is
trying to prevent it from being turned into a housing site. <br>
<br>
Lynne picks up Missile's body to take with her. Sissel is wondering why
Detective Jowd claimed to have taken the man's life when it was a
meteorite fragment that did it. Lynne and Sissel head back to the
minister's office. Lynne presents the box and Jowd opens it, taking out
the gun. Based on the evidence, the minister believes he must call off
the execution. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2:35am</span><br>
<br>
Talk to Detective Jowd. Jowd thanks Sissel for his aid tonight and
Sissel says he's no longer doing all this just for himself. He believes
they are all connected somehow. Lynne wonders if she was a victim of
manipulation. It seems likely that's the reason why she shot Sissel.
She also wonders why that contraption seems so familiar and Sissel
reminds her about the one in the basement. Jowd has never even heard of
the junkyard and never told anyone about the contraption either. Sissel
then talks about Temsik and points out Jowd claimed to have taken the
man's life. Jowd blames himself for the death regardless of the
meteorite because he was about to shoot that man. The moment he drew
his gun, in his eyes, he was already a murderer. Lynne protests that he
was just trying to save her but he doesn't think so. There was an
incident in another place where a suspect escaped interrogation and
Jowd chased him down. He fired the gun and made the man panic, driving
him to take Lynne hostage. <br>
<br>
Jowd believed that Alma's death was fate, punishment for the crime he
had committed. He painted portraits of people's faces in his cell.
Tonight, he painted his final face, the face of the man in the park
that day. The very face Sissel is wearing. Sissel can't believe it. He
couldn't really be the man from the park, could he? Jowd points out
that the man's name wasn't Sissel and he's been wondering the whole
time just who Sissel really is. <br>
<br>
Before anyone can ponder on this issue much longer, the phone rings.
It's Cabanela and he orders the minister to be quiet and listen to his
demand. He wants the execution to take place tonight and then the
hostage will be released. He hangs up, leaving the minister incredibly
freaked out. <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 15</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2:55am</span><br>
<br>
Sissel is in for yet another shock. He sees "himself" pointing a gun at
Inspector Cabanela's corpse. The "other Sissel" makes a phone call to
Commander Sith, that eyebrowed blue man from before, telling him he'll
be there soon then hangs up. The room the commander and his servant are
in is revealed to be on a submarine. "Other Sissel" salutes the dead
inspector then walks out, leaving Sissel alone with the corpse.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2:56am</span><br>
<br>
Possess Cabanela's corpse. The inspector is still unconscious so we'll
go on ahead and view the last four minutes of his life.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">== 4 Minutes Before Death ==</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2:50am, Maint. Building - Super's
Office</span><br>
<br>
Cabanela was just finishing off the phone call and hung up, crouching
over in pain. It turned out he was making that phone call because the
"other Sissel" asked him to. Cabanela asks him why he's doing this and
he replies that it's revenge against the people who took his life away.
He's adamant that he was murdered - by Jowd, who chased him down,
Lynne, who was there when he was running for it, and Cabanela, who did
something though he didn't specify. He then accused Cabanela of
deliberately hauling Jowd in to protect his spotless record. Cabanela
whipped out his gun and shot the man in red. He fell on the stepladder
and it rolled back forward. The man then slowly stood up, appearing
unharmed by the bullet, and took Cabanela's gun from him, using it to
shoot him dead.<br>
<br>
Be very careful. Don't use your ghost tricks in front of the man in red
because he knows about them too. Sissel will notice the strange waves
coming from his body again. We saw them before at the bottom of that
crater where Missile died. Are they really the signs of having powers
of the dead? Well, maybe not exactly. Possess the kettle and wait for
him to bang on the stove, knocking the kettle down. Go down into the
room below. It looks like an explosion took place here and there's
another death lying hidden in the room. Move the hoist and it falls
down. Go to the toolbox and open it up. Jump across the cores to the
pigeon man's corpse and possess it.<br>
<br>
The pigeon man is awake and he hasn't lost his memory. He wonders why
Cabanela would bring the guy who blew the place up along but Cabanela
tells him it was a different guy. There isn't a way to save the
inspector yet, so let's go back in time to before the pigeon man's
death and see what we can do from there.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">== 4 Minutes Before Death ==</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2:42am, Maint. Building - Basement</span><br>
<br>
The pigeon man, or professor, was inspecting the man in red's corpse
while Cabanela was sitting down nearby. Cabanela warned him that they
should get out of there but the professor wasn't about to do so.
Cabanela pointed out that the manipulator's true form was actually a
spirit and he just wasn't there. Actually, he was, and it soon became
very apparent. The manipulator got up from the table and talked about
how he manipulated the justice minister and even Lynne. He made her
shoot his "shell", knowing the camera would capture the "murder", and
Lynne would be found guilty of murder. He then informed the professor
it was time to die. He would be leaving the country tonight but before
he did that, he had to wipe out all evidence of his powers. He then set
off the contraption. Cupid rose up and fired its arrow without turning
around. There was dynamite on the table. Cabanela jumped in to save the
professor but it was too late and the professor was killed in the
explosion.<br>
<br>
Sissel actually can't do very much. Possess the measuring device, sit
there and wait for the four minutes to run out. As the seconds start
counting down, a dialogue bubble pops up. Read it. They hear someone
crying out to Sissel to help him. Better find them. Move the screen to
the bottom right corner near the bin with the rats and a leaf comes
floating by. It's Missile and he readily agrees to help out. Now we can
actually get somewhere. <br>
<br>
Missile can do the rest from here, because Sissel's useless right now.
Swap the two newspaper piles and the rats come scampering over to the
bin, knocking off the lid. As it's rolling away, swap it with the tire.
The lid will fall down. When it's still, swap it with the trapdoor. The
pigeon man falls down and avoids getting killed in the explosion. <br>
<br>
While the manipulator oh so kindly manipulates the injured Cabanela up
the stairs, the pigeon comes down to check on the professor. Missile
goes up ahead to wait for Sissel. The pigeon man asks the pigeon to
carry the measuring device up to the top. When the pigeon's close
enough, jump onto the hoist. Go to the room above and Missile greets
you. Now we have to save Cabanela somehow, without the man in red
noticing.<br>
<br>
When the kettle falls down, while controlling Sissel, use it to go up.
When the manipulator's back is turned, quickly swivel the desk lamp and
move to the hard hat then jiggle it. It will fall to the floor. Then
put Sissel on the motor. After the manipulator is shot, possess the
stepladder and roll it to the other end of the room and move up to the
knit hat. Jiggle it and it falls down. Roll the stepladder back. Have
Missile swap the knit hat with the book. It falls down and lands neatly
on the hook. When the man in red shoots, swap the knit hat with the
bullet.<br>
<br>
The manipulator doesn't notice Cabanela being hit in the face with a
knit hat and goes to the phone. Now both Cabanela and the professor
have been saved. It turns out Cabanela and the pigeon man were working
together to research the manipulator and his powers. They return to the
present.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">3:14am</span><br>
<br>
Talk to Cabanela. Sissel mentions how the man in red swore revenge
against those who took his life and brings up the part where he
mentioned Inspector Cabanela as one of those he wanted revenge on.
Cabanela talks about how the Special Investigation Unit was working on
a certain big case and brought in a witness. He had just been accepted
into the unit and wanted to impress them so he pressured the suspect
even though he was only supposed to take his statement. He pushed him
too far and made him lose all hope. On top of that, Cabanela was called
away and left his gun in the room. The man used the gun to escape.<br>
<br>
Cabanela then talks about the manipulator. They found out about his
existence during an overseas communication. He was making a deal with a
foreign country and wanted them to buy him and his powers. He gave them
two predictions to prove his powers - he foresaw the cases at the
Special Prison, namely the curry lover who would take the chief
commissioner hostage and the rock star who would sing out national
secrets. The SIU launched an investigation and managed to pinpoint the
meeting place and staked it out tonight. They have been unable to find
out where the submarine will surface and want to prevent the powers
from landing in those foreigners' hands at all costs. <br>
<br>
On the subject of Cabanela's spotless record, he reveals that it's
because of his spotless record he could become head of the SIU and
oversee all aspects of the manipulator case. All this was in order to
try and prove that Jowd was innocent. Cabanela hauled him to the
justice minister to try and hold off the execution. He couldn't simply
let him escape because it would be a crime. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">3:23am</span><br>
<br>
Talk to the pigeon man. It turns out he wasn't always a junkyard
superintendent. He was once a medical examiner who worked with the
police. One day, he was asked to autopsy a strange corpse. The victim
was hit by a meteorite fragment and died instantly.</span></span><span
 class="style4"><span class="style5"> The corpse was unusual in that
there wasn't a scratch on him and the professor was unable to even cut
him with his scalpel. </span></span><span class="style4"><span
 class="style5">He was never able to file an autopsy report because the
corpse vanished.</span></span><span class="style4"><span class="style5">
There was only one way the corpse could have disappeared - it got up
and walked out on its own.</span></span><span class="style4"><span
 class="style5">&nbsp; There was still a clue left behind - the strange
radiation that emitted from it. The professor went to the crater where
the meteorite fell and found the exact same radiation coming from the
meteorite. He quit his job as a medical examiner to research Temsik in
full and came to learn about the connection between his research and
the manipulator case.<br>
<br>
A year before, Cabanela arrived at the office. He was investigating the
manipulator case at the time and heard about a man who quit the force
to study the meteorite. At one point, while listening to the
communications, he heard the manipulator state that the source of his
powers was not of this world. It was then that Cabanela realised that
the manipulator case and Temsik were connected. It's also revealed that
the professor built the contraption in the room to try and help Jowd.
There was a part he couldn't reproduce - the part that made Cupid turn
around. And so, the existence of the manipulator was proven. <br>
<br>
Lynne turns up and is shocked to see Inspector Cabanela. After some
explaining goes on, she apologises now that she knows what's really
going on. Cabanela didn't want her to be involved, which was why he had
her arrested. Cabanela's pretty upset about getting hurt in the
explosion. Then Jowd turns up. It seems that the minister called off
the execution and let Jowd go free until the next morning. Jowd tells
Cabanela to leave the rest to him. The professor hands Jowd his coat.
He then goes off, thanking Cabanela for the gift. Lynne speaks to
Sissel, asking him to wait until they can get the phone on the
submarine hooked up, then leaves. <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 16</span><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">4:19am</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The phone in the superintendent's office rings and he comes to answer
it. It's Jowd, calling for Sissel. He heads on over to the submarine.
The lights in the room come on and Jowd realises he isn't alone, Sith's
servant is also in the room. The servant brings up the communication
screen and Sith appears on the screen to speak to Jowd. He's surprised
that Jowd could have made it to the submarine. It turns out the bullet
Cabanela fired into the manipulator was a radio transmitter disguised
as a bullet and the watch he gave Jowd was a radio receiver.<br>
<br>
Jowd asks where the man in red is and the chair is turned round to
reveal that he's sitting right there. However, it's only his body and
his spirit is elsewhere, likely controlling Kamila. Jowd begs Sith to
let her go, but Sith isn't interested in hostages. He has what he needs
now - the source of the manipulator's powers. The man in red has
underestimated them by leaving the fragment alone. A strange capsule
comes up on the table and plucks the fragment from the man's body then
disappears into the chute below. Sith bids farewell and the screen goes
blank. The servant taps the control panel and the entire command room
goes rocketing off away from the submarine with Jowd still inside.<br>
<br>
In the distance, Sissel hears a loud explosion and moments later, the
lights go out. Now he needs to find Lynne and Kamila, and fast.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">4:26am</span><br>
<br>
When you enter the ghost world, you'll notice a flame close by. It's
Missile. After a little chat, the phone starts ringing. Better get over
there quickly. Have Missile swap the baseball with the middle
basketball. Move Sissel across to the right emergency light. Then have
Missile swap the baseball with the right basketball. The phone falls
off the hook. Send Sissel to the phone. It's Kamila, and she needs
help. It seems that something happened to Lynne. Go there.<br>
<br>
Kamila hangs up the phone since nobody is answering. Lynne is dead
again, floating in the water below. What a surprise. Sissel and Missile
talk to Kamila. Sissel asks Missile to watch over Kamila while he goes
to aid Lynne.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">4:31am</span><br>
<br>
Go down and turn the wheel then possess Lynne's corpse. She doesn't
have much of a clue how she managed to die since it was so sudden. She
explains that after she and Jowd left the office, they tracked down the
man in red to a boat. They stowed away on the boat and snuck onto the
submarine when it surfaced. It went down again and they split up. He
went to hook up the phone while she went to look for Kamila. Lynne
found Kamila hiding in the engine room after she escaped and ran away
there. She doesn't remember what happened after that. Might as well go
back and see for ourselves what happened.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">== 4 Minutes Before Death ==</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">4:22am, S-Yonoa Engine Room</span><br>
<br>
Lynne was watching over the unconscious Kamila when she woke up. The
little girl sat up... and immediately tried to brain her with a machine
gun. It turned out she was being possessed by the manipulator. He had
been waiting there for Jowd to come, planning to kill him in Kamila's
body. Something struck the submarine hard and then the manipulator
began to realise something was wrong. Lynne noticed the ceiling fall
down and ran to shield Kamila. At that moment, there was an explosion
that killed Lynne.<br>
<br>
Wait for Possessed!Kamila to point the gun and jump across the cores to
the ringing phone. Manipulate the wheel above it. It will fall off,
knocking the handset down. Go to the phone. A crew hand is calling the
engine room, warning whoever's on the phone to hurry over because they
are evacuating the submarine. Go there and jump across the cores to the
wastebasket. Open it and very quickly jump into the ghost world, then
possess the basketball. When the basketball goes up, possess the
emergency light. The Temsik fragment will be ripped out of the man in
red's body and it comes down the chute. When it's close enough, possess
the capsule.<br>
<br>
The capsule goes on into Sith's escape vessel. He removes the Temsik
fragment then tossess aside the capsule. He detaches the control room
and then a torpedo bay opens up, revealing a torpedo. Sith makes his
escape from the submarine. Lynne realises that the torpedo is the cause
of the giant explosion and they have to do something before it's too
late.<br>
<br>
Go to the lever and lower it, then hop into the torpedo. There's
nothing they can do to stop it from launching but maybe there's still
something that can be done afterward. Stop the gyroscopes when they are
both sticking up. The torpedo will turn over and the rat falls off. Now
operate the joint and the safety device is clamped on, which prevents
the torpedo from exploding. Unfortunately it's still going to impact. <br>
<br>
Back in the present, things are still looking bad. Lynne might be alive
but water is seeping into the engine room from where the torpedo
struck. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">4:40am</span><br>
<br>
Operate the starter, which gets the gears moving. Sissel comments on
it. Operate it again and jump across the cores while the gears move.
When you get to the torch, Kamila wakes up. After a brief talk with
Lynne, she passes out again. Lynne swears she'll get her out of there,
no matter what. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">4:45am</span><br>
<br>
Turn on the flashlight. Lynne goes to pick it up. She can't open the
door because of the water pressure so the only way is up. Jump to the
emergency light then go to the handle above and turn it. Steam comes
out of the pipe, knocking down the glove. Follow the path to the switch
and lower it. The ladder comes down and Lynne climbs up. The submarine
suddenly rocks, almost causing her to fall off. Then the flashlight
stops working. Turn it on again. Now they just need to get to that door
and they are safe.<br>
<br>
... Or not, as the submarine suddenly capsizes and Lynne falls to the
bottom. Fortunately, she survives, but now the water is rising quickly
and she and Kamila are in great danger.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">4:50am</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Enter the Ghost World and Sissel spots Missile. He will help out with
getting Lynne and Kamila back to the top. <br>
<br>
Now, while in control of Missile, go to the fans and re-arrange them.
There's a small fan that's easy to miss, a little way above, so watch
out for it. Arrange the fans so that large is on bottom, medium is in
the middle and small is on top. With that done, go up to the pipes. The
top pipes will be referred to as A1 (left) and A2 (right) and the
bottom ones are B1 (left) and B2 (right) Swap A1 and B2, then swap A2
and B1. <br>
<br>
Sissel's turn. Wait for Lynne to point the flashlight at the water then
go over to the starter and manipulate it. The pipes form a staircase
for Lynne to go up. She gets stopped at the pipes because of the hot
steam coming out however. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">4:58am</span><br>
<br>
Operate the starter again and ride the gears to the top. Jump to the
wheel above Lynne and turn it. The steam is cut off and she's able to
cross safely. Now how is she supposed to get up there to the door? <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">5:06am</span><br>
<br>
Go across the cores to the hook, which is close to the door, and move
it down. Lynne will climb onto the hook. Move it back up. Lynne tries
to open the door but is unable to. Try to open it for her. Sissel can't
do it either. The water rises higher and higher. Lynne screams in
terror. The door suddenly opens and a giant clamp bursts in, grabbing
Lynne and Kamila and whisking them out of the engine room. The door is
shut, preventing the water from going any further.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 17</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">5:10am</span><br>
<br>
The thing that saved Lynne and Kamila is now looking down at them.
Lynne looks up and freaks out at the sight of it. It falls to pieces
and then the pieces come together to form a metal body. It's none other
than the manipulator. He doesn't really know why he saved Lynne and
Kamila. Apparently he knew about Sissel saving Lynne all along. Sissel
pleads for him to tell him who he is... and changes his own appearance
in the process. He can't hold onto that image of himself any longer.
The manipulator is sure Sissel will remember himself soon enough... and
who he (the manipulator) is too, surprising Sissel. Does he know the
man?<br>
<br>
The submarine has been totalled. It's sinking and the engine room is
destroyed. Lynne wonders why the manipulator is here seeing as he had a
deal with them. He says he was betrayed. They figured out the source of
the powers. Lynne asks to hear more about the meteorite's effects on
living creatures.<br>
<br>
The manipulator watched the junkyard super do his work for all those
years and managed to figure some of it out. Those with powers of the
dead received them by dying in the presence of Temsik radiation. He
then talks about the meteorite's effects on his body. His entire
existence has become a contradiction. The fragment remained inside his
body and continued to regenerate it. The body was cycling between the
moments that separated his life and death. He simply existed, neither
alive nor dead, and his body never changed. It was stuck at the moment
of his death. <br>
<br>
Next, he talks about his revenge plot. The kidnapping was done in order
to ensure that Jowd was executed. The foreigners had their own reasons
for co-operating with him though he didn't realise it at the time. They
wanted to wipe out everyone who had to do with Temsik - Jowd, Cabanela,
the pigeon man... and the man in red himself. There was one more target
- Lynne. He lured her to the junkyard, told her he was the man who took
her hostage and manipulated her into shooting him. She was only
supposed to be framed for murder but the organization had other ideas
and wanted her wiped out. Then Sissel showed up and threw a wrench in
their plans.<br>
<br>
Lynne wonders why she was a target when she didn't even know about
Temsik. It was because she was looking into the Jowd case and the
organization was afraid she would learn about Temsik sooner or later. <br>
<br>
The submarine shakes again. Now all that's left to do is wait for water
pressure to crush the submarine. There aren't any cores from there to
the water's surface and there are no communication cables down that
deep. It's looking pretty hopeless. Lynne tells the manipulator she
understands how he's been feeling those ten years. It must be just like
the feeling of being cut off from the world, all alone in a submarine
and sinking slowly toward the bottom of an endless sea. <br>
<br>
Kamila comes round, She aware that they are trapped on the submarine
and bets Jowd would save them if he was there, upsetting Lynne
somewhat. While everyone's wallowing in despair, Sissel speaks up about
how strange it is that the man's body was ejected into the sea. He
doesn't know and guesses it doesn't matter now since they have no idea
where it is. At that moment, Lynne realises that they do and produces
the radio receiver. With it, they should be able to find out where the
command room is since the man in red's body is still there with the
bullet inside it. She thinks they could use a torpedo to get there
somehow.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">5:27am</span><br>
<br>
Go up to the control panel and operate it. A mechanical arm pops out.
Use it to get to the phone above. Go to the torpedo room. Lynne and
Kamila go up as well and Lynne observes that the torpedoes can be
launched manually. She turns on the backup power so that the switches
can work.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">5:30am</span><br>
<br>
The switch isn't doing anything so talk to Missile and you'll gain
control of him. Have him swap the switches, then have Sissel move the
leftmost switch. The torpedo pops out of the bay. Lynne has noticed
that the command room is slowly sinking for some reason. Hop over to
the torpedo. Before she launches the torpedo, Sissel tells Missile to
get on but he wants to stay there with Lynne and Kamila. He feels he
can't leave them alone. Lynne and Kamila manage to persuade him to go
and he joins Sissel on the torpedo. Lynne and Sissel exchange farewells
then Lynne pulls the switch and the torpedo shoots off. It passes by
the control room and Sissel and Missile hop over. Detective Jowd is
lying dead on the floor and the command room has lost all power.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">5:41am</span><br>
<br>
Possess Jowd's corpse. Jowd is startled since he doesn't recognize
Sissel at first. Sissel tells him about Kamila and Lynne's predicament.
Jowd can't believe he would destroy his own submarine and wonders why.
The manipulator responds that it's because Sith was afraid of his
powers. Apparently he was able to tag along without Sissel noticing.
Jowd wonders if he is Yomiel. Then the manipulator's form changes to
reveal his true form. His real name is indeed Yomiel and Sissel was
just an alias he was using for his deal with the organization. Sissel
would like to ask him some more questions.<br>
<br>
Ten years ago, Yomiel was a top systems engineer. He was invited into a
project aimed at reorganizing the nation's top secret information. He
never thought that he would have to deal with spies. Since he built the
core of the system, he was a suspect and was hauled in for questioning.
Then that incident happened. Yomiel asks when he was proven innocent
and learns it was six months after his death. <br>
<br>
Yomiel talks about his death ten years ago. He lost everything when his
soul was split from his body and found himself sealed in eternal
darkness. His powers couldn't help anyone and nobody noticed him. Time
didn't help, it just made his suffering even worse. He wanted to
disappear but wasn't able to even do that. He was overwhelmed by
loneliness and despair, and wanted everyone to suffer what he was
suffering... leading to him murdering Jowd's wife. Yomiel wanted him to
know what it was like to lose everything he cared about. His loneliness
had poisoned his mind and made him twisted.<br>
<br>
When Yomiel was plotting his revenge, he had an idea. He would use his
powers to make a deal. They would get his powers and in return, Yomiel
would get a new life. He had two conditions - they help him with
revenge, and give him a rebirth. He didn't care if it was an artificial
life. He only wanted a physical identity and a normal life, and wished
to grow old in a society that accepted him then die surrounded by a
loving family. To make it all come true he knew it would take a lot of
money and power so he contacted the organization. Their response in the
end was, of course, betrayal.<br>
<br>
The organization had sent spies to the country and researched his
powers without him knowing. They managed to find out the truth behind
Temsik as well. They couldn't steal a piece of the meteorite because
Cabanela and the junkyard super had notified the government about the
source of the manipulator's power and they responded by hiding armed
guards in the park who would protect the meteorite. The housing site
was really a plot by the government to secure the meteorite. <br>
<br>
Now that we've learned all that, it's time to go back to before Jowd's
death.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">== 4 Minutes Before Death ==</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">4:23am, S-Yonoa Control Room</span><br>
<br>
Jowd asked the servant where they were going. It turned out the control
room only had enough fuel to be launched away and would sink. Jowd
points out that would mean the servant was trapped too, but the servant
was just a remote controlled robot. Jowd asked why they went to so much
trouble, ejecting the body. The servant responded that Sith likes to
guard against any possibility no matter how small, though he wouldn't
say what. The servant then made a machine gun come out of the ceiling
which shot Jowd dead.<br>
<br>
There's nothing to do but possess Yomiel's corpse. Yomiel figures out
what the possibility is. His time was perpetually stopped thanks to
Temsik, but now that the fragment was removed, his body became a
regular corpse. Sissel realises this means they can go back to four
minutes before Yomiel's death. Missile wonders when exactly that death
is and Jowd replies that they will find out when they get there.<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">== 4 Minutes Before Death == <br>
<br>
</span></span></span><span class="style4"><span class="style5"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">5:26pm, Temsik Park<br>
<br>
</span></span></span><span class="style4"><span class="style5">Lynne
was about to eat her baked potato when Jowd and Yomiel came running and
Jowd fired the gun, making Yomiel take Lynne hostage. A kitten came and
rubbed against Jowd's leg, mewing. Jowd told the kitten to get away
because it was dangerous. Then the meteorite crashed down and the
fragment hit Yomiel.<br>
<br>
They may actually be able to save Yomiel from his fate of being hit by
the Temsik meteorite, but Jowd isn't so sure. He's afraid he'll shoot
Yomiel and he'll die anyway, but Yomiel can accept that. What he did
was inexcusable and he can accept dying.<br>
<br>
When Lynne is being held hostage, go across the cores to her headphones
and turn them up. This causes Lynne to drop her baked potato. Head over
to the basket and rock it. The sweet potato falls out. Now go to the
nozzle and when the potato is floating close to it, spray. The jet of
water should propel the potato in the air. Possess the potato before
it's out of range and Sissel will land on the large fountain. Now put
Sissel in the fountain and have Missile go over to the floating potato.
Have Sissel spray Missile up into the air.<br>
<br>
Up there, have Missile swap the potato with Mino, then swap Mino with
the right post lantern. Don't exit the ghost world between steps as
this will cause Mino to crash down and you'll have to restart. Now Mino
is on top of the lamp post and should get in the way of the meteorite
fragment.<br>
<br>
The meteorite falls and the fragment glances off Mino. It sails over
Yomiel and shoots through Jowd's leg. He collapses and the gun shakes
in his hand. Ghost!Jowd yells at him to drop the gun even though he
can't hear him. Then the gun goes off. Missile quickly stops time by
going into the Ghost World, swearing he won't let Jowd become a
murderer.<br>
<br>
Swap the bullet with the baked potato. Yomiel is sent flying and ends
up impaled on the lamppost. Sissel fears the worst, but Yomiel quickly
assures him that he's still alive.<br>
<br>
It's too soon to relax however as the lamppost starts bending over
under the weight of Mino. Mino begins to fall and there's nothing that
can be done. Sissel refuses to give up and freezes time before it can
hit her. Yomiel wonders why he doesn't just let it play out and possess
her corpse. Sissel doesn't want Lynne to have the memory of dying since
she's so young. Yomiel comes up with a plan and has Sissel move over to
the left nozzle. Spray, and the lantern goes flying over. Then it's
Missile's turn. Swap Mino with the lantern.<br>
<br>
Mino is still falling but Yomiel isn't bothered. He can manipulate
living things and is going to manipulate his own body to save Lynne. He
pulls himself off the lamppost then throws Lynne over to Jowd. Mino
falls down on top of his legs.<br>
<br>
Lynne wakes up in Jowd's arms. He asks her to call the police for him
and even gives her a toy badge. Lynne races off to do as he asked and
Jowd approaches Yomiel, asking if he's still alive. Fortunately, he is
and tells Jowd his body was moving all by itself like he was being
controlled, but he's glad it happened. Lynne comes back and finds an
unconscious kitten in the grass. It's the same kitten from earlier and
Jowd offers to take it home.<br>
<br>
Yomiel observes that his fate just changed in a big way. Sissel wonders
whose fate he means and Yomiel replies he meant the kitten's of course,
and gives his name - Sissel. Sissel remembers that is in fact his real
name. Yomiel states that during those lonely ten years, Sissel was his
only friend, and asks if he remembers now. It all comes back to Sissel.<br>
<br>
Ten years ago, he was a lonely kitten who wandered into the park. After
Yomiel died, he possessed Sissel's body and lived with him for a while
before reclaiming his own body. He went to see his fiancée but she had
committed suicide to join him. Yomiel named the kitten after her.
Tonight, he was carrying Sissel in a bag since he had no intention of
leaving him behind. He manipulated Lynne into shooting him and then
left in Sissel's body, since leaving in his own body wouldn't make it
look like a murder. When possessing Sissel, he came to realise
something horrible. Sissel was dead. When Yomiel manipulated Lynne, the
first shot was off and the bullet hit Sissel. He died in the presence
of Temsik radiation and received his ghost tricks.<br>
<br>
Sissel realises now why he was unable to get his memories back.
Yomiel's corpse was the only one he could see at the time. His true
death was hidden in the bag all along. </span></span><span
 class="style4"><span class="style5">Sissel asks Yomiel why he never
tried to stop him when he was saving Lynne tonight. Yomiel tells Sissel
that he was unable to replay a death, let alone change fate. Had he
been able to do so, he would have saved Sissel, as well as his fiancée.
</span></span><br>
<span class="style4"><span class="style5"><br>
Now that fate has changed, a new future awaits everyone. Yomiel reveals
that he's glad his revenge failed. When Lynne told him she understood
how she was feeling, he changed his mind about revenge. It's time to
get back, but Yomiel points out the past won't disappear completely.
The memories of those who are there in the past (Sissel, Missile, Jowd,
Yomiel) will remain. After exchanging words, everyone sets off back to
the new present.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Ray appears before Sissel. He's going to show his true self
to Sissel but before that, he tells him a story. Had Sissel not saved
Lynne tonight, she would have died in that lonely junkyard. Then Tengo
and Yomiel (who took his body with him since Lynne was dead and it was
useless to frame her for murder) broke into the apartment and stole the
wooden box. In the process, two little dead bodies were left behind -
Kamila's and Missile's. Missile reached out a paw to his mistress and
activated his ghost tricks. It turned out he had died in the presence
of the radiation coming from Yomiel's body. Missile was unable to save
his mistress and chased after the men but was still unable to do
anything and ended up in the control room with Yomiel's corpse. Then he
went back ten years in time. There he waited until that night came
round again.<br>
<br>
Ray reveals his true form - an older Missile. Ten years is a long time
in dog years. After those ten years had gone by, he had grown old and
his powers were weak. He needed somebody else to help him, so he
enlisted the aid of Sissel. Sissel points out that he manipulated the
desk lamp and Missile tells him his powers changed over those ten
years. His power to swap object faded, but he became able to manipulate
objects. Sissel asks why he couldn't simply work with himself and
Missile replies that he couldn't go through phone lines. It was a very
important ability when chasing somebody. <br>
<br>
Sissel wonders how Missile knew Sissel could use phone lines in the
first place. It turns out that Missile met Sissel on that night the
first time around. He heard that Lynne lost her life in the junkyard
and made his way over there. There, he saw Sissel manipulating the desk
lamp. That Sissel actually refused to co-operate with Missile, shocking
Sissel. His self in the first timeline only wanted to find his lost
memories then fled over the phone line. Sissel apologises for not
helping him. The next time around, Missile decided he would use
Sissel's desires to find his lost memory to their mutual advantage.
Missile would guide him along the right path to Yomiel. On top of that,
he would give him a time limit. The disappearing at dawn thing was in
fact a lie. Missile only said that to make sure Sissel got to the
submarine in time, otherwise Yomiel would have been trapped at the
bottom of the sea forever and it would all have been over. <br>
<br>
Now that the ten years will cease to exist, Missile will disappear
along with them. He thanks Sissel for his work tonight and bids him
farewell. Now it's time for Sissel to return to the present.<br>
<br>
Lynne has come into Jowd's house and wonders why it's so dark. She
flips on the light and the contraption is set in motion. At least this
time, it does what it's supposed to do. Kamila comes running out from
the cupboard along with Sissel and explains about the contraption.
Lynne points out it's not her birthday. Jowd comes in and says it
doesn't matter, since they are celebrating the birth of her position as
detective. He introduces Lynne to Kamila, who congratulates her on
becoming a detective. She notices Lynne's badge, saying she got one
like it, but hers appears much older. Jowd asks how long Lynne is going
to wear the toy badge and Lynne says it's the sign of being a real
detective. Sissel mews to get her attention. Lynne wonders if it's the
same kitten and Jowd confirms it. Kamila tells her that Sissel is a
very special kitten who hasn't aged in the whole ten years. Upon
hearing his name, Lynne thinks it sounds familiar. Kamila's mother
comes over to say it's time for the celebration to begin. Lynne picks
up Sissel and speaks to him. After a little monologue from Sissel, we
see him enter the Ghost World and Temsik radiation flows from his body.
It appears that the fragment hit him and now he's in the same state
Yomiel was, minus the suffering and despair.<br>
<br>
After that, the credits roll. We are treated to various scenes,
including Cabanela arriving at the celebration party with Missile in
tow. At the end, we see Yomiel being released from jail after a ten
year long sentence.</span></span><br>

<span class="style2"><strong>
<center>** BONUS DEATHS **</center>
</strong><br>
<br>
There are at least two opportunities during the game where you can make
a death even worse than it was in the first place. They are definitely
worth doing at least once.<br>
<br>
When saving Detective Rindge, just stay in the van and don't do
anything. When the detective is driving off toward the Chicken Kitchen,
recline the seat.<br>
<br>
When saving Inspector Cabanela (after you save the pigeon man), don't
use any ghost tricks and just wait. When Yomiel shoots at Cabanela,
swap the bullet with the hard hat.</span>
