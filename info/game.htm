Ghost Trick is a visual novel/puzzle style game originally released for the Nintendo DS and ported to iOS, created by Shu Takumi, who is well known for being the
creator of the Ace Attorney series. Takumi first started thinking about making Ghost Trick in 2004, when the Ace Attorney series were finished. Then the 
Nintendo DS came out and the decision was made to port the AA series over to the DS and so Ghost Trick had to wait until the ports were done. Ghost Trick also
features music composed by Masakazu Sugimori, who worked on the score for the first Ace Attorney game.
<br />
In 2023, a remaster of Ghost Trick was announced, to be released on Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4, XBox One, and Steam in summer of that year. It is a fully
remastered release, with upgraded visuals and sound, as well as extra content new to the game, and also features a remastered soundtrack composed by Yasumasa
Kitagawa, the composer of Great Ace Attorney.<br />
<br />
You start off the game as a ghost named Sissel who has just died. He
wakes up to see a woman held at gunpoint and thinks he can't do
anything about it because he's already dead. However, it turns out he
has received the powers of the dead, "ghost tricks". With these ghost
tricks, he is able to manipulate the environment around him and manages
to save the woman from her fate. He then realises that he has lost his
memory and sets out on a quest to find them, as well as solve the
mystery behind the strange things that are happening in this town
tonight.<br />
<br />
Though Ghost Trick hasn't had huge sales on the DS, it has been well received for
the most part by those who have played it. It was the second
best-selling video game in Japan during its first week and was
nominated for Best DS Game of E3 2010 by GameTrailers, though it lost
to Okamiden. The game has a metascore of 83. It is generally praised
for the story, unique gameplay and the characters. <br />
