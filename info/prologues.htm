Tonight, at a junkyard on the outskirts of town, a certain someone was killed. <br />
<br />
The stories of "Four Prologues"
recount the hours leading up to the event through the eyes of the four people who were there when it all went down.<br />
<br />

			  <br />
			  Bang!<br />
			  <br />
			  My vision faded to black at that sound.<br />
			  A sound that echoed through the junkyard.<br />
			  <br />
			  It was... a sound I'd heard before.<br />
			  Like something from the TV.<br />
			  <br />
			  Just as it was fading from my mind,<br />
			  my body was wracked by an intense pain.<br />
			  <br />
			  And that...<br />
			  <br />
			  Was the moment I realized:<br />
			  <br />
			  I was the one who was dying.<br />
			  <br />
			  Suddenly...<br />
			  <br />
			  A strong, horrible scent stabbed at my nose.<br />
			  It wasn't the scent of garbage, it was something else entirely<br />
			  -- something I'd never smelled before.<br />
			  <br />
			  Wait, no.<br />
			  <br />
			  I did recognize it.<br />
			  <br />
			  Long, long ago...<br />
			  <br />
			  I'd smelled it just once, when I was still young.<br />
			  <br />
			  A familiar... and foreboding smell...<br />
			  <br />
			  ..........<br />
			  <br />
			  And then...<br />
			  <br />
			  I heard the sound of the curtain falling on my story.<br />
			  <br />
			  To be continued...<br />

			  When did it get so late?<br />
			  <br />
			  Maybe if I leave the precinct now and really floor it,<br />
			  I can still make it in time?<br />
			  Yeah, I'll be fine. I'm a detective, after all.<br />
			  <br />
			  Oh, who's that coming this way?<br />
			  It's the Chief of the Special Investigations Unit!<br />
			  <br />
			  "Looks like you're all ready to go."<br />
			  "H-Hey, Chief...! What's up?"<br />
			  "What do you mean, 'What's up?' Don't tell me you forgot."<br />
			  <br />
			  Drat!<br />
			  That's exactly what happened.<br />
			  <br />
			  I was promoted to detective recently-- just this past autumn, in 
			  fact.<br />
			  And instead of some stuffy speech to mark the occasion,<br />
			  I said we should go for dinner sometime... I think.<br />
			  <br />
			  "I'm so sorry! I... kinda have somewhere to be."<br />
			  "Now? And where are you going at this time of night, eh?"<br />
			  "Umm, uh..."<br />
			  <br />
			  Look, I'm not some bad guy who can lie convincingly on the spot.<br />
			  I'm a detective, after all!<br />
			  <br />
			  "Th-The junkyard on the outskirts of town."<br />
			  "The junkyard? You going there to throw something out?"<br />
			  "Not... exactly."<br />
			  "Then you're going there to pick something up?"<br />
			  "........."<br />
			  <br />
			  Help. I don't know how to respond to that.<br />
			  Because that's technically what I'm planning to do... sorta.<br />
			  <br />
			  The Chief's face clouded over in annoyance.<br />
			  <br />
			  "I don't believe this. Are you saying garbage is more important 
			  than me?"<br />
			  "No, that's not it at all..."<br />
			  "Besides, you're the one who picked tonight in the first place."<br />
			  <br />
			  Ah, I did, didn't I?<br />
			  <br />
			  ...Oh, well.<br />
			  <br />
			  Guess I don't have a choice. I'll just have to go eat with the 
			  Chief.<br />
			  <br />
			  And when I do...<br />
			  <br />
			  I'll have to find the right moment to knock him completely 
			  unconscious.<br />
			  <br />
			  Or would that be going too far?<br />
			  <br />
			  Definitely not. The Chief would understand.<br />
			  This is an emergency. No one would ever blame me...<br />
			  Or is that only wishful thinking?<br />
			  <br />
			  "...You're right."<br />
			  "Thank you."<br />
			  "Give me a second, though."<br />
			  <br />
			  ...To find the weapon that will hurt the least.<br />
			  <br />
			  Just then...<br />
			  <br />
			  "Ah, darn it!"<br />
			  "Chief?"<br />
			  "Sorry, but I'm going to have to reschedule."<br />
			  "Huh?"<br />
			  <br />
			  Well, that was unexpected.<br />
			  ...As if this whole conversation we're already having isn't 
			  already that.<br />
			  <br />
			  "I just remembered my wife asked me to take out the trash."<br />
			  "I-I see."<br />
			  "Before she gets home, I mean."<br />
			  "U-Understood, Chief! Loud and clear!"<br />
			  <br />
			  I give him a salute as he leaves.<br />
			  <br />
			  After all of that...<br />
			  <br />
			  I guess trash turned out to be more important than dinner for both 
			  of us.<br />
			  <br />
			  At least, that's what I'm gonna tell myself.<br />
			  <br />
			  In any case, I'm glad that's settled.<br />
			  <br />
			  Because I absolutely, positively have to be at the Zone D Waste 
			  Center tonight.<br />
			  <br />
			  [Zone D Waste Center]<br />
			  <br />
			  I'm running out of time, and the bad feeling I have is only 
			  getting worse.<br />
			  <br />
			  If I don't hurry...<br />
			  <br />
			  To be continued...<br />

			  The bartender places a glass in front of me.<br />
			  <br />
			  "Your Salty Dog."<br />
			  <br />
			  The world... is an ugly mess.<br />
			  It's full of things best ignored or overlooked.<br />
			  That's why I engage in this small act of resistance:<br />
			  <br />
			  I will never get a pair of glasses.<br />
			  And I will certainly never wear one.<br />
			  <br />
			  The world... is an ugly mess.<br />
			  And if you're not wearing a glasses, there's a lot you don't have 
			  to see.<br />
			  My colleagues call me "Nearsighted Jeego."<br />
			  Not that I mind.<br />
			  I have no problem with it.<br />
			  <br />
			  But also...<br />
			  <br />
			  That's why the world... is an ugly, blurry mess.<br />
			  <br />
			  The bartender places a glass in front of me.<br />
			  <br />
			  "Your dry martini."<br />
			  <br />
			  I look over at the musical instrument case on the stool next to 
			  me.<br />
			  Inside it, my little golden friend is fast asleep.<br />
			  The job tonight... is at a junkyard on the outskirts of town.<br />
			  Pros go where the work is, no matter how smelly.<br />
			  <br />
			  My heart rate increases steadily.<br />
			  <br />
			  It's just about time.<br />
			  <br />
			  I lift one hand ever so slightly and signal to the bartender.<br />
			  He nods, just as slightly.<br />
			  No words wasted.<br />
			  <br />
			  I like this place. Think I'll drop in on my way home.<br />
			  <br />
			  The bartender places a slip of paper in front of me.<br />
			  <br />
			  "Your check."<br />
			  <br />
			  I look at the bill.<br />
			  <br />
			  .........<br />
			  <br />
			  It's so blurry I can't read it.<br />
			  <br />
			  "How much is it?"<br />
			  <br />
			  ...Seems I've run up quite the tab.<br />
			  That's what I get for ordering without being able to see the 
			  prices.<br />
			  <br />
			  Life can be a real pain when the world is an ugly, blurry mess.<br />
			  <br />
			  ...Alright.<br />
			  <br />
			  I'll get some glasses.<br />
			  <br />
			  As soon as I finish this job... I'm going to get myself a pair.<br />
			  <br />
			  The thought flashes through my mind.<br />
			  <br />
			  I grab the case beside me and leave the establishment.<br />
			  <br />
			  Time for work, and for the curtain to rise.<br />
			  <br />
			  To be continued...<br />
			  <br />
<br />

			  It's been a long, long time, yes.<br />
			  A long time to be all alone.<br />
			  You could say, I'm an existence that doesn't exist in the real 
			  world.<br />
			  <br />
			  Now, in my twilight years...<br />
			  Well, I don't have much -- not even fond memories to look on, 
			  really.<br />
			  All I know is an absolute... and desperate...<br />
			  Loneliness.<br />
			  That is all.<br />
			  <br />
			  Still...<br />
			  <br />
			  The front curtain of night will be lowered before this mountain of 
			  trash soon.<br />
			  The stage is set, the start of our story is near.<br />
			  You can almost make out the first strains of the overture in the 
			  distance.<br />
			  <br />
			  ...And there it is.<br />
			  <br />
			  Bang!<br />
			  <br />
			  It's finally time.<br />
			  <br />
			  Act I has begun.<br />
			  <br />
			  To be continued...<br />
