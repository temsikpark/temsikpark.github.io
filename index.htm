            Hello, and welcome to Temsik Park, the first dedicated
            fansite created for Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, available on Nintendo DS, iOS, Nintendo Switch, 
            Playstation 4, Xbox One and PC! <br />
              <br />
            This site aims to be a top resource for fans of the game.
            You can find all sorts of Ghost Trick related media here,
            and it serves as an useful source of information about the
            game as well. <br />
              <br />
            If you have stumbled upon this site by accident or are just
            looking to find something out about the game in the event
            that you're curious and have yet to play it, then tread
            carefully. I try to be careful about spoilers but you may
            end up accidentally spoiling yourself - and Ghost Trick is
            something you do not want to spoil. If you haven't played it
            yet, then you are seriously missing out. <br />
              <br />
            Ghost Trick is a wonderful game from the creator of Ace
            Attorney with a vivid cast of characters and masterful
            storytelling as well as a great soundtrack. I would
            recommend it to anybody. Then you can come back and take a
            look around the site. <br/>
              <br />
            Have fun looking around and enjoy your stay! <br />
